# CPS_Project
This project is done for the course cyber physical system. The goal of the project is to develop a functioning prototype for remote access management system where RFID tags will be used in order to gain access to certain vicinity in an organization, schools, universities, hospital, sports arena or so...

The project is based on ESP-12 wifi module and intel galileo borad. The galileo is used to read the RFID tags and hardwired with ESP-12 through serial such that the RFID tag number read is fed into the ESP-12 and the tag number ultimately directed to a php server in order to check the existence of the tag number in the system to decide whether or not to grant the access.
